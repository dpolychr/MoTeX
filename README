Basic Instructions
==================

   This installation requires the pre-installation of the ANSI C99 
library implementation of the double-array trie data structure. It can 
be found here:

   The shell command `make -f Makefile.CPU.gcc' should compile this 
program. You may use `make -f Makefile.CPU.icc' in case you want to
use the Intel C++ Compiler for the compilation. 

After compilation the binary `motexCPU' will be created in the working 
directory, e.g. you may call it from this directory via

`./motexCPU -a DNA -i INPUT -o OUTPUT -d 1 -q 3 -l 5 -e 1'

Use the command `./motexCPU -h' for the help output.
   
   The shell command `make -f Makefile.MPI.gcc' should compile this 
program for MPI. You may use `make -f Makefile.MPI.icc' in case you 
want to use the Intel C++ Compiler for the compilation.

After compilation the binary `motexMPI' will be created in the working 
directory, e.g. you may call it from this directory via

`mpirun -np 64 ./motexMPI -a DNA -i INPUT -o OUTPUT -d 1 -q 3 -l 5 -e 1'

to make use of 64 processes.

Notice that the specifics of the MPI invocation, i.e. the exact form of 
`mpirun' depends on your local cluster configuration.

The best option is to contact your cluster administrator, or check if 
there is any on-line documentation on how to invoke MPI programs.
