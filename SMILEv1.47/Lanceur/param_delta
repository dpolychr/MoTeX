## In the following example, we use "deltas". It means that the model we
## look for must respect the following criteria:

FASTA file              fasta
Output file             delta
Alphabet file          alphabet
Quorum                  70
Total min length        5
Total max length        6
Total substitutions     0
Boxes                   2

BOX 1
Min length              2
Max length              3
Substitutions           0
Min spacer length       2
Max spacer length       8
Delta                   1
## here we want a jump of d plus or minus delta between the 2 boxes 
#$ where d can take a value from 3 to 7. Here, the generated ranges will be:
## [2-4], [3-5], [4-6], [5-7], [6-8].
## As many output files will be generated as the number of possible 
## ranges.

BOX 2
Min length              3
Max length              3
Substitutions           0

## Here you can add the evaluation step, each output file will be evaluated.
